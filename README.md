## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

### Programming Setup
There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

### Resoures
In this project, [Kaggle Survey data 2020](https://www.kaggle.com/c/kaggle-survey-2020) was used.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

As one of aspiring data scientists, I would like to get some insights of becoming a data professional based on the Kaggle Survey data. 

1. There are many titles, which one is suit for you? 
There are many roles related to data professionals. 
(activities, 교육, programming years, ML years, compensation, 
incoporation of ml into their business (Practical or research) )
    ● Business Analyst
    ● Data Analyst
    ● Data Engineer
    ● Data Scientist
    project manager 
    ● DBA/Database Engineer
    ● Machine Learning Engineer
    ● Research Scientist
    ● Software Engineer
    ● Statistician
    ● Other

-> Categorize the jobs on Engineer, Analysist, Research, business? 

2. What kinds of programming languages or tools are good for aspiring data scientists? 
(1) based on titles(Q5), 
(2) if using ML is important to choose your job 
(3) if Databse
(3) based on company size(Q20), if you are targetting to big company 
(4) if you preffer to work in small or large team size(Q21) 
    - programming language
    - IDE 
    - hosted notebook products
    - platforms
    - hardware 
    - data visualization libraries
    - machine learning frameworks 
    - ml algorithms 
    - computer vision methods
    - NLP methods  
    - cloud computing platforms(Q26-A), products(Q27-A)
    - learning platforms 
    - analyzie data 


3. what kind of title I need to pursue based on my skills? 

4. HOw much I can expect my future salary based on years of prograaming, years of ML using, level of education, age, country, gender, programming langauages, learnig platforms to learn data science? favorite media source to report on data science? and skill sets. 

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There are 3 notebooks available here to showcase work related to the above questions in detail.  Each of the notebooks is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title.  Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.  

There is an additional `.py` file that runs the necessary code to obtain the final model used to predict salary.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@josh_2774/how-do-you-become-a-developer-5ef1c1c68711).

The summarized code and description can be found at the Kaggle post available 

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

Must give credit to Stack Overflow for the data.  You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the Kaggle link available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/stackoverflow/so-survey-2017/data).  Otherwise, feel free to use the code here as you would like!
