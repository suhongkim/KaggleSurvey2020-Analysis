## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

### Programming Setup
There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

### Resoures
In this project, [Kaggle Survey data 2020](https://www.kaggle.com/c/kaggle-survey-2020) was used.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>
As one of the job seekers who want to work in the data science field, I have been struggled to figure out what job title is suited for me. This project is searching for some answers using the Kaggle DS&ML Survey 2020 dataset. 

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>
I combined all the code into the one notebook which also can used in the Kaggle Notebook platform 

## Results<a name="results"></a>
